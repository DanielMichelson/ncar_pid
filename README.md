Installation instructions are found in the INSTALL file.

This package is an add-on to the BALTRAD Toolbox (RAVE) for particle
identification using an interface to NCAR's software, along with an NCAR
algorithm for processing KDP at S band.

Many thanks to Mike Dixon at EOL, NCAR and Mark Curtis at the Australian
Bureau of Meteorology for facilitating this interface.

RAVE and its packages can be found at git.baltrad.eu.
