INSTALL for ncarb

Daniel Michelson
Environment and Climate Change Canada

ncarb works with Python 2.6.x and higher, also 3.5 and higher, together with
a RAVE installation.
RAVE and its packages is found at git.baltrad.eu.

You must set the RAVEROOT environment variable. This is the path to the root
of your RAVE installation, e.g. /opt/baltrad . The Makefiles are already 
configured appropriately, and will use the information you used when building 
RAVE. This applies to the full path to your env in a conda build as well.

Build everything at once with a simple 'make', or if you only want the C 
functionality, go to the 'src' directory and issue 'make' there.

Run unit tests with 'make test'. These unit tests require the full build, ie.
that 'make' has been issued at the top level.

Install the built add-on with 'make install'. This will add the command-line 
binary and compiled Python module to your RAVE installation.

Generate the in-line documentation with doxygen, by issuing 'make doc'.
